# cloud-itonami-isco-7534

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 7534**: Upholsterers and Related Workers.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an upholstery workshop scheduling and logistics coordination practice: a workshop scheduling and supply-coordination robot manages crew/task records under a governor-gated actor, so an upholstery workshop crew keeps its own operating records instead of renting a closed workforce-management SaaS.

ISCO-08 7534 covers upholsterers and related workers who use hand tools (staple guns, tack hammers, cutting knives) and handle padding/foam materials — a standard workshop hand-tool hazard. This actor's scope and hazard reporting cover that hand-tool/material-handling hazard profile without ever performing the upholstery work itself.

**Maturity: `:implemented`.** `src/upholcoord/` implements the
`UpholCoordActor` as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
(`upholcoord.actor`) wired to an `Upholstery Coordination Advisor`
(`upholcoord.advisor`) and an independent `UpholCoordGovernor`
(`upholcoord.governor`), following the itonami actor pattern
(ADR-2607121000): `:intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit
(:ok?) +-> :request-approval (:escalate?, human-in-the-loop interrupt)
+-> :hold (:hard?)`. 24 tests / 52 assertions green (`clojure -M:test`).
HARD invariants (always hold, never
overridable): upholsterer provenance, workshop provenance, no-actuation
(`:effect` must be `:propose`), a closed op-allowlist
(`:log-work-record`, `:schedule-crew-operation`,
`:flag-safety-concern`, `:coordinate-supply-order` — nothing else may
ever be proposed), and a permanent, unconditional block on any
proposal that would directly finalize an upholstery-execution decision
(e.g. deciding an upholstery job is finished) or a
workshop-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring a workshop
safety-cleared), or override a shop safety officer's judgment. Always-
escalate paths (human sign-off regardless of confidence, mapping this
repo's Trust Controls in
[`docs/business-model.md`](docs/business-model.md)):
`:flag-safety-concern` (always) and `:coordinate-supply-order` above
the registered cost threshold.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a workshop scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling, job/commission/progress-record logging and padding/fabric/frame-materials supply-order coordination for an upholstery workshop crew, under an actor that proposes actions and an independent **Upholstery Coordination Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself, never performs upholstery work on the shop floor, and never finalizes an upholstery-execution decision or a workshop-safety-clearance decision, nor overrides a shop safety officer's judgment; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as a flagged hand-tool-hazard/material-handling/equipment-condition concern, or an above-threshold supply order) require human sign-off. **This actor coordinates workshop scheduling/logistics only — it never performs upholstery work or makes safety-clearance decisions itself.**

## Core Contract

```text
crew roster + workshop registration + safety-reporting policy
        |
        v
Upholstery Coordination Advisor -> UpholCoordGovernor -> log/schedule/coordinate, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, finalize
an upholstery-execution decision, declare a workshop safety-clearance,
override a shop safety officer's judgment, suppress an operating record, or
disclose sensitive data without governor approval and audit evidence.
