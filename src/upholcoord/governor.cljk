(ns upholcoord.governor
  "UpholCoordGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating
  every upholstery workshop scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor
  may make for an upholstery workshop crew. ISCO-08 7534 (Upholsterers
  and Related Workers) works with hand tools (staple guns, tack
  hammers, cutting knives) and handles padding/foam materials — a
  standard workshop hand-tool hazard — so this governor's
  hazard-escalation path covers hand-tool-hazard /
  material-handling-hazard / equipment-condition. The governor never
  dispatches hardware itself, never performs upholstery work itself,
  and never finalizes an upholstery-execution decision (e.g. deciding
  an upholstery job is finished) or a workshop-safety-clearance
  decision (e.g. declaring a workshop safety-cleared), nor overrides a
  shop safety officer's judgment — those are permanently out of this
  actor's scope and remain a shop safety officer's exclusive judgment
  (README's 'Robotics premise': this actor coordinates WORKSHOP
  SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never performs upholstery work or
  makes safety-clearance decisions itself). Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7319's craftcoord.governor (closest published,
  tested generic workshop scheduling/logistics coordination pattern).

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. upholsterer provenance — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. workshop provenance    — the workshop site must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never performs upholstery work itself;
                                it only gates what the advisor may
                                coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize an
                                upholstery-execution decision (e.g.
                                deciding an upholstery job is
                                finished) or a workshop-safety-
                                clearance decision (e.g. declaring a
                                workshop safety-cleared), or to
                                override a shop safety officer's
                                judgment, is a hard, permanent block
                                (checked both against the proposed
                                :op and, defense-in-depth, against the
                                proposal's :rationale text — matched
                                as full finalization/execution ACTION
                                phrases such as \"finalize the
                                upholstery operation\" / \"declare the
                                workshop safety cleared\" / \"override
                                the shop safety officer's judgment\",
                                never as bare nouns like \"staple\",
                                \"foam\", \"fabric\", \"upholstery\"
                                or \"safety\", so the check can never
                                self-trip on the advisor's own routine
                                rationale text, e.g. \"logged work
                                record for upholsterer …\" or
                                \"scheduled crew operation for
                                upholstery task …\" or \"…routed for
                                shop safety officer review\" — all
                                three legitimately contain those bare
                                nouns but none is a finalization
                                action, and all are exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`.
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
    6. :op :flag-safety-concern (a hand-tool-hazard /
                                material-handling-hazard /
                                equipment-condition concern always
                                escalates to a human, never
                                auto-commits).
