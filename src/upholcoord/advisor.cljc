(ns upholcoord.advisor
  "Upholstery Coordination Advisor — proposing an upholstery workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a work record,
  schedule a crew operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a
  padding/fabric/frame-materials supply order) from a crew roster,
  workshop registration and safety-reporting policy. Swappable
  mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes — `upholcoord.governor`
  independently gates every proposal and always escalates safety
  concerns and above-threshold supply orders. ISCO-08 7534
  (Upholsterers and Related Workers) works with hand tools (staple
  guns, tack hammers, cutting knives) and handles padding/foam
  materials — a standard workshop hand-tool hazard — so hazard
  reporting here covers hand-tool-hazard / material-handling-hazard /
  equipment-condition. The advisor never proposes to directly
  finalize an upholstery-execution decision (e.g. deciding an
  upholstery job is finished) or a workshop-safety-clearance decision
  (e.g. declaring a workshop safety-cleared), or to override a shop
  safety officer's judgment — those stay permanently out of this
  actor's scope. Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-7319's
  craftcoord.advisor (closest published, tested generic workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination pattern).

   advisor covering ISCO-08 7534 (Upholsterers and Related Workers) —
   a workshop craft that uses hand tools (staple guns, tack hammers,

   any :cost/:hazard-type/:task fields, an honest :confidence and a

   propose to directly finalize an upholstery-execution decision

   workshop-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring a workshop
   safety-cleared), or to override a shop safety officer's judgment —
   those are always out of this actor's scope; it coordinates

   work or makes safety-clearance decisions itself. Safety concerns
   always require human sign-off regardless of confidence.")
